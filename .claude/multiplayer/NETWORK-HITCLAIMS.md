# Hit claims, and who decides a kill

Code: `Mods/Network/NetHitClaims.cs`. Protocol 7. The third piece of the same
machine as [lag compensation](NETWORK-UNLAGGED.md) and
[instant hit registration](NETWORK-PREDICTION.md), and the one that answers the
complaint those two leave standing.

## The fault

The rewind fixed *where* a shot is resolved. The prediction fixed *when* the
shooter is told. Neither can do anything about the cases where the shooter and
the authority are not running the same test at all:

| | |
|---|---|
| **the rewind hit its ceiling** | measured on this box at 320 ms with 80 ms of jitter and 2% loss, over two scenarios: **80.0% and 88.9% of shots clamped**, 2.8 and 3.2 frames of rewind refused each. The requested-depth histogram's *mode* was two frames past the ceiling in both — the distribution folded onto it, not a tail touching it. In the first, the shooter's own machine resolved 17 of the 23 hits the authority credited it with, and 2 of its 9 headshots came back as body shots |
| **the trigger pull was recovered from a press history** | so the packet carrying it acks a newer world than the one the finger moved in |
| **the shooter was killed during the round trip** | the authority never runs the shot: its copy of that player was already dead when the intent arrived, and a dead player's presses do nothing |

The third is the one players call unfair rather than laggy. You shoot, the body
drops on your screen, and then it stands back up — because the person you shot
had already killed you on the machine keeping score.

## What a claim is

`PacketType.HitClaim`, client → authority, 27 bytes: the claim id, the shooter's
own frame, **the authority frame whose world it was resolved against**, the
victim slot, the beam, the damage, a flags byte (headshot / lethal / frozen),
and where the shooter's copy of the victim was standing.

`PacketType.HitVerdict` comes back: applied, already resolved, void because the
shooter was dead, void because the victim was down, refused, or too old.

Claims are declared from `NetHitPrediction.NoteHit` — every hit this machine
resolves for its own player on somebody else, **every weapon**, not only the
Imperialist. The sniper is the instrument the rig measures with because its
headshot band is 0.3 units and its damage is a one-shot kill; the mechanism has
nothing to do with which gun fired.

## What the authority checks

`Judge`, in the order that costs least:

1. the slots are real, and nobody claims a hit on themselves — your own splash
   is arithmetic both machines run identically from the same inputs;
2. the frame named is inside the rewind history;
3. the damage is no more than that weapon can deal with **every** multiplier
   in the game stacked at once (charged headshot × double damage × Double
   effectiveness × the high damage level);
4. the victim was in play at that frame, and is worth damaging now;
5. **the victim's body, as the authority's own history holds it at that frame,
   is within 2.0 units of where the claim says the hit landed.**

Five is the one that makes the rest safe, and it is worth being precise about
what it compares. It is *not* a tolerance on aim. The claim carries where the
shooter's copy of the victim stood; the authority compares it against its own
record of where that player stood in the frame the shooter was looking at. So
the only thing a client can assert is that the two machines agreed about where
somebody was — which the authority can check, because it wrote the number. A
claim can only ever rescue a hit the authority's own history says was there to
be had.

2.0 units against a hunter 0.90 across and 1.60 tall: it covers a client whose
puppet is a frame or two of physics from the authority's (measured at up to
0.377 units a frame for a player in the air) and refuses a claim about somebody
two body-lengths away. 4.0 for a hit with no beam behind it — an alt form's
scythe, spin or trail, a bomb — which land at arm's length or in a blast.

## The grace window, and why a claim is not applied when it arrives

The authority is simulating the same shot from the same intent. Its own answer
arrives around the same time as the claim: earlier for a hitscan weapon, later
for anything that travels. Applying a claim on arrival would double the damage
of every shot the authority was going to resolve anyway, which is almost all of
them.

So a validated claim **waits 18 frames** and is dropped the moment the authority
resolves a hit from that shooter on that victim — in the window before it
arrived as well as the window after. What survives the window is a hit the
authority was never going to find, and that is the only kind applied.

The shooter does not wait: the prediction already showed them the hit on the
frame they fired it. What the window costs is 300 ms before the *victim* learns
about a rescued hit — against the alternative, which is not learning at all.
`NetHitPrediction.HoldFrames` carries the same 18 frames so that the shooter's
hold on the victim's health does not expire before the answer arrives.

## The arbitration

> *Si client A fait un headshot sur client B, malgré la latence le kill doit
> toujours être pris en compte. Sauf si client B a tué client A avant.*

A claim carries the world-frame its shooter was looking at. That is the clock
two people who killed each other are separated by:

- **dead now is not the test.** A player killed during the round trip still
  gets the shot they took before it happened. That is the whole point.
- a shot is **void** if its shooter had been put down by a hit aimed at a
  **strictly earlier** world than the one this shot was aimed at;
- two shots aimed at the same world **both count** — a trade, which is the
  honest answer to a trade.

Because the ordering is by the shooters' own stamps and not by which datagram
won the race, the outcome does not depend on arrival order. That is why claims
are resolved **in fire-frame order at the end of their grace window** rather
than one at a time as they land: applied on arrival, A-then-B and B-then-A give
opposite winners for the same duel.

The stamp is taken in `NetDamage.Note` — the authority runs it for every hit it
resolves — and `TrackDeaths` copies whatever is standing there onto the slot the
frame it goes down. A death with nothing behind it (the void, a crusher, the
clock) is stamped with the present, which is the truth for something nobody
aimed.

## What this changed elsewhere

**Predicted kills on other players are back on** (`DeathEnabled`). They were
turned off because a client could kill the same opponent twice for one kill on
the scoreboard: the authority disagreed silently and the next snapshot stood the
body up. The authority no longer disagrees silently — a kill this machine shows
is one it has told the authority about, which comes back applied, already
resolved, or refused *with a reason*, inside one round trip. `-nodeathprediction`
is the control.

**The rewind ceiling moved from 24 frames to 45** (400 ms → 750 ms). A claim is
a backstop, not a substitute: the cheapest hit registration is still the one the
authority finds itself, and the histogram above says the old ceiling was
refusing nine shots in ten at the latencies this work is about.

## Reading the numbers

The client's line:

```
hit claims: 16 declared, 2 applied, 14 already resolved (100.0% stood),
            0 void (dead shooter), 0 void (victim down), 0 refused,
            0 unanswered, 2 repeats
```

**`already resolved` is the healthy majority and `applied` is the rescue.** A
run where everything is `already resolved` is one where the rewind did the whole
job unaided, which is what a clean line should look like. `refused` climbing is
the number to chase: on a clean conscience it means the two machines' copies of
somebody have drifted more than 2 units apart.

The authority's, in the server log every 30 s:

```
sim: hit claims (as authority): 28 received, 2 applied (13 damage, 0 kills,
     0 headshots rescued), 24 already resolved, 0 from a shooter already dead,
     0 on a victim already down, 0 refused, 0 too old, 2 repeats
```

`kills rescued` and `headshots rescued` are the ones the complaint is about.
Each is a shot that landed on the shooter's screen and would have counted for
nothing.

## Verified 2026-09-14 (WSL, loopback with latency injected)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `run-check.sh 70 Samus Weavel Sylux`, **no lag** | **0 mismatches**; 56 claims received, **54 already resolved**, 0 applied, 0 refused, 0 unanswered. This is what a clean line is supposed to look like: the rewind does the whole job and the claim rescues nothing |
| the same with `-noclaims -nointerp -relayedpuppets -nodeathprediction` | the one pre-existing `damage-taken` mismatch reproduces identically (26 against 13/15), so it is not this |
| `-hitrig duel`, **350 ms ± 80 with 2% loss**, 150 s, `TEST PADS` | **26 received, 12 applied — 1338 damage, 12 kills, 12 headshots rescued — against 3 already resolved.** The authority's own simulation found three of the fifteen real hits in that duel |
| the same run, client side | **`headshots: 14 predicted, 12 agreed by the authority (100.0%), 0 downgraded to body shots`**, and `14 kills predicted, 1 undone`. The protocol-6 arms of the same rig read 63.6% and 75%, with 2-4 downgraded each |
| rewind, all protocol-7 arms | **clamped 0**, worst asked 40-43 against the 45-frame ceiling, 0 history misses |

**The duel is the run that matters and it is worth saying why.** In a duel at
350 ms the authority discards almost every shot, because whoever is hit first
has their return fire thrown away -- their copy on the machine keeping score is
already dead when the intent arrives. `3 already resolved` against `12 applied`
is that, measured. Neither the rewind nor the prediction can reach it; only a
claim can.

**`0 from a shooter already dead` in every run so far.** That is the
arbitration's permissive branch working -- two shots aimed at the same world
both count -- and the refusal branch is still unexercised. See
`.claude/KNOWN-GAPS.md`.

These runs shared the box with an unrelated 27-room sweep for part of the
afternoon, and three earlier arms were killed outright by the memory pressure.
Treat the timing figures as indicative and the counts as exact.

## The arbitration is about when the trigger was pulled

A claim carries two frames and they are not the same question:

| | what it names | used for |
|---|---|---|
| `AckFrame` | the world the shooter's screen was showing when the hit **resolved** | looking the victim up in the authority's history, and the age check |
| `LaunchFrame` | the world the shot was **fired** in (`BeamProjectileEntity.ModLaunchFrame`) | pairing the claim with the authority's own hit, and **the arbitration** |

The arbitration used the ack, and that is wrong for anything that travels. A
Missile is in the air for the better part of a second: judging it by the ack
asks *"were you already dead when your rocket landed"* instead of *"were you
already dead when you fired it"*, and voids a shot that left the gun before the
shot that killed its shooter had even been aimed.

**It is invisible on a fast weapon**, whose two frames are within a frame of
each other, which is exactly the shape the complaint arrived in: kills undone
with the Missile and the Magmaul, none with the Power Beam or the Imperialist.
Measured against the Japan server at 250 ms, `void (dead shooter)` went from
**20 to 0** in a three-minute run.

The same error had a second half on the authority's own side.
`NoteAuthorityHit` stamped a victim's death with `FireFrameOf(attacker)` --
the attacker's ack *now*, at impact -- so a slow projectile's kill recorded the
wrong world in `_lastHitFire`, and that number is what every later claim on
that player is judged against. It takes the launch frame too.

`LaunchFrameFor` produces the same quantity on both machines, which is what
makes the comparison sound: the authority's rewind target for somebody else's
shot, and the playout read point for this machine's own -- the same number the
intent acks.

**What is left in that bucket is a different question.** `void (victim down)`
is now the largest refusal (11 in the same run) and it is not arbitration: it
is `TakeDamage` refusing to hurt a corpse, judged at the moment the claim
arrives. It decides who gets the *credit* for a kill that happened either way,
not whether a body gets up, and it has not been touched.

## Two things a verdict is also good for

### Retiring the shooter's prediction exactly

A claim's id names one hit. Nothing else on this wire does: the snapshot
carries a count of hits on a victim and the slot of only the **last** attacker,
so a client's own hit followed inside one snapshot window by somebody else's is
never matched, and `NetHitPrediction.Confirm` is not even called for it. Its
debit then stays on the shooter's books while the authority's own health
already has it, the victim is drawn lower than they are, and a shot or two
later the client predicts a kill on somebody comfortably alive — reported as
*"my client thinks three missiles killed him"*, which is three points of stale
debit against a 99-health hunter.

So every verdict now retires the prediction its claim was declared under:
`Applied` and `Duplicate` as confirmed, every refusal and the six-send timeout
as denied. See `NETWORK-PREDICTION.md`, *Retiring a prediction*.

### Measuring whether the two machines agree about the damage

A claim carries the number the **shooter** computed for a shot, and the
authority already pairs it with its own hit for the same shot in order to
refuse it as a duplicate. So the ledger keeps the authority's damage beside
each entry, and `TakeLedger` hands it back on a match: the pair is a free,
exact measurement of whether the shooter's prediction and the authority's
resolution agree, per weapon, in a real match.

`DescribeAgreement` prints it on the server's `sim:` report, and a disagreement
is logged by name the first twenty times. Both sides run the same table over
the same weapon, so anything short of 100% means one of them is reading a
quantity the other was never sent. The five that existed were the charge tier,
double damage, the alt-form ram, the damage level and the affinity-weapons
rule — all five now travel (see `NETWORK-PREDICTION.md`, *The same test needs
the same inputs*). The one left is Weavel's halfturret health, which is why a
hit split with a turret is not allowed to predict a death.

A zero on the authority's side is not a disagreement: it means the ledger entry
carries no damage, which is every entry from a build before this and every hit
applied out of a claim.

## What it depends on, and what turns it off by accident

- **`-nohitprediction` turns claims off too.** A claim is a hit *this machine
  resolved*, and without prediction a client resolves none — `NetDamage.Suppress`
  throws them all away before `NoteHit` is ever reached. That is not a coupling
  to remove: there is nothing to declare.
- **`-nounlagged` turns claims off too, and more quietly.** `NetUnlagged.Record`
  returns early when the rewind is off, so the authority has no history, and
  `Judge` cannot check a claim against nothing — every one comes back
  `ResultTooOld`. Both switches are controls for measuring, and the pair is
  really one arm: without the rewind there is no world to agree about.
- **A server that is relaying rather than simulating drops claims.** It has no
  history either. The client repeats six times, gives up, and plays the game
  every build before protocol 7 played.

## Traps

- **A claim is not applied through a beam, because there is no beam.** It goes
  through `TakeDamage` with the shooter as the source, so the damage sequence,
  the scoreboard, the death and the snapshot that carries all three are the
  paths that already work. `NetDamage.SetClaimedBeam` is what stops the victim
  replaying a nameless hit; the Judicator's freeze travels as a claim flag and
  is re-applied by hand, since the affliction is produced inside `TakeDamage`
  from a beam entity that only ever existed on the shooter's machine. The
  knockback is **not** rescued: it is a velocity the authority's own resolution
  would have supplied and this hit did not have one.
- **`NetHitClaims.Tick` must run before `NetHooks.AfterSimulation`.** That is
  where the authority applies what it is rescuing, and a hit applied after
  `BroadcastSnapshot` sits a whole frame waiting for the next one.
- **The verdicts are buffered for a frame.** They arrive in two places —
  `Receive` answers what it can refuse on sight, `Tick` answers what waited out
  its grace — and a client repeating six claims in one packet would otherwise
  be answered with six datagrams.
- **A server that does not simulate drops claims.** It has no history to check
  one against. The client repeats a few times, gives up, and plays the game
  every build before protocol 7 played.
- **Repeats are counted separately on both ends** or the outcomes do not add up
  to what was received, and a line reading `8 received, 1 applied, 2 already
  resolved` looks like five lost claims rather than five repeated ones.
