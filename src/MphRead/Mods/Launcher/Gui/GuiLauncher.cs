    ///
    /// - Avalonia allows one application per process. A second
    ///   <c>AppBuilder.Setup</c> throws, so a launcher that stood one up per
    ///   visit worked exactly once and fell back to the text screen on the way
    ///   back from the first match.
    /// - macOS will not accept UI work off the main thread. AppKit is not
    ///   thread-safe, which rules out the private UI thread the WinForms
    ///   launcher used.
    /// - The screens are rendered in the middle of the game's frame, by the
    ///   thread drawing it. Nothing else can pump the dispatcher they post
    ///   their work to.
    ///
    /// The backend is headless plus Skia rather than the platform's own: the
    /// screens are drawn into a buffer and composited into the game window
    /// (<c>UiSurface</c>, <c>Mods.Render.UiOverlay</c>), so this
