    /// picker answers a question in two, and the map -- the thing that
    /// actually decides what the next seven minutes are like -- was announced
    /// rather than asked. It was announced from
    /// <c>MatchStatePacket.NextRoomKey</c>, one line reading "NEXT: COMBAT

    /// vote, which interrupts the match it is called in. That is the wrong

    /// nothing else to do.
    ///
    /// So the results screen carries the whole map list and the room votes on
    /// it. It is the same callvote, moved: picking a map is proposing it,
    /// picking the map somebody else picked is validating it, and picking a
    /// different one is proposing that instead -- the alternative to agreeing
    /// is naming another map rather than saying no to this one, which is the
    /// only part of a vote that changes shape here. **The map with the most
    /// votes is the one loaded** -- no threshold, because an intermission
    /// interrupts nobody and a bar to clear only produces the outcome nobody
    /// voted for, a room that picked three maps and is sent to a fourth. With
