    /// instead of being rasterised into the screens' texture with them.
    ///
    /// **Why it moved.** The screens are rasterised by Skia on the CPU and
    /// uploaded as one texture, and that raster is capped at 1920x1080 and
    /// magnified -- it has to be, because a redraw is the whole window and a
    /// 4K one costs about 60 ms, which is a menu that scrolls at seventeen
    /// frames a second (<see cref="Launcher.Gui.UiSurface"/> carries the
    /// measurements). The cap is the right trade for type and rows: they are
    /// redrawn whenever anything moves.
    ///
    /// The photograph is not like that. It never changes, it is the single
    /// largest thing on the screen, and it was paying the cap for nothing --
    /// on a 1440p or 4K display the launcher's backdrop was a 1080p picture
    /// stretched over the window, which is exactly the softness that was
    /// reported after the launcher stopped being a window of its own (it used
    /// to be an Avalonia window drawn by the platform at native resolution).
    ///
    /// So it is uploaded once as a texture and drawn as one quad under the
    /// screens. The cost is a textured quad a frame on the GPU -- nothing that
    /// shows on a frame graph -- against the whole backdrop's worth of CPU
    /// raster it takes off the bake, and the picture is now as sharp as the
    /// window is big.
    ///
    /// **The washes stay where they are.** The gradient and the vignette are
    /// still drawn into the screens' own bitmap, above this, and the composite
    /// comes out identical: the overlay is blended premultiplied
    /// (<c>One, OneMinusSrcAlpha</c>), which is the same "over" operator
    /// Avalonia applied when the two were in one bitmap. A gradient also
    /// survives being magnified in a way a photograph does not -- it is smooth
    /// by construction, and the magnification dithers the steps rather than
    /// showing them.
    ///
    /// Decoded here rather than through Avalonia, for the reason
    /// <see cref="AppIcon"/> gives: this is GL's side of the window, it is
    /// compiled into builds that have no toolkit, and avares:// needs Avalonia
    /// to read. The JPEG therefore travels as a plain embedded resource as
